## About
React/Express CRUD app based on test assignment. Super basic Express & SQLite backend (just to make it work).
A couple of React components to view/edit cat info.

## Setup locally
Use _nginx_ with .conf file to avoid CORS problems. Put appropriate env values to .env files (client/server).
And then launch both _start_ npm script.
